## Support-Vector-Economics

### To train the SVM Classifier and report the results:

```
python train.py --kernel poly --degree 5
```
Kernel must be one of linear/poly/rbf/custom.


### Guide

- Metrics Table.xlsx contains the **average** results on the "*^ NSEI (3).csv*" dataset.
- The code reports results for all subsamples, in addition to reporting the average results.


### To do

- Run the code on the dataset Sir provided and report the results.
- Update the Latex file.
- Run the code for linear kernel (SVC with linear kernel takes hours to train).
